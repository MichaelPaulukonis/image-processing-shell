A couple of random scripts I use often

See `docs/notes.md` for random notes on command-line usage etc.

## panorama

Some notes and scripts that attempted to force joins where joins should not be.

## renamer-browser

browser-based app that that allows me to go through a directory of images and rename them with a series of tags. Basically, the filenames will server as meta-data.
